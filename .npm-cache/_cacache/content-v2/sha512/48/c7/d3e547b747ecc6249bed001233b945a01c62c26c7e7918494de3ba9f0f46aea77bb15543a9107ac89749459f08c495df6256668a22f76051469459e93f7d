This is most useful in environments where `cross-fetch` is not compatible, for instance Cloudflare Workers:\n\n```js\nimport { PostgrestClient } from '@supabase/postgrest-js'\n\nconst REST_URL = 'http://localhost:3000'\nconst postgrest = new PostgrestClient(REST_URL, {\n  fetch: (...args) => fetch(...args),\n})\n```\n\n## Development\n\nThis package is part of the [Supabase JavaScript monorepo](https://github.com/supabase/supabase-js). To work on this package:\n\n### Building\n\n```bash\n# Complete build (from monorepo root)\nnpx nx build postgrest-js\n\n# Build with watch mode for development\nnpx nx build postgrest-js --watch\n\n# Individual build targets\nnpx nx build:cjs postgrest-js   # CommonJS build\nnpx nx build:esm postgrest-js   # ES Modules wrapper\n\n# Other useful commands\nnpx nx clean postgrest-js       # Clean build artifacts\nnpx nx format postgrest-js      # Format code with Prettier\nnpx nx lint postgrest-js        # Run ESLint\nnpx nx type-check postgrest-js  # TypeScript type checking\nnpx nx docs postgrest-js        # Generate documentation\n```\n\n#### Build Outputs\n\n- **CommonJS (`dist/cjs/`)** - For Node.js environments\n  - `index.js` - Main entry point\n  - `index.d.ts` - TypeScript definitions\n- **ES Modules (`dist/esm/`)** - For modern bundlers\n  - `wrapper.mjs` - ESM wrapper that imports CommonJS\n\n#### Special Build Setup\n\nUnlike other packages, postgrest-js uses a hybrid approach:\n\n- The main code is compiled to CommonJS\n- An ESM wrapper (`wrapper.mjs`) is provided for ES Module environments\n- This ensures maximum compatibility across different JavaScript environments\n\nThe `wrapper.mjs` file simply re-exports the CommonJS build, allowing the package to work seamlessly in both CommonJS and ESM contexts.\n\n### Testing\n\n**Docker Required!** The postgrest-js tests need a local PostgreSQL database and PostgREST server running in Docker containers.\n\n#### Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Run all tests (from monorepo root)\nnpx nx test:ci:postgrest postgrest-js\n```\n\nThis single command automatically:\n\n1. Cleans any existing test containers\n2. Starts PostgreSQL database and PostgREST server in Docker\n3. Waits for services to be ready\n4. Runs format checking\n5. Runs TypeScript type tests\n6. Generates and validates TypeScript types from the database schema\n7. Runs all Jest unit tests with coverage\n8. Runs CommonJS and ESM smoke tests\n9. Cleans up Docker containers\n\n#### Individual Test Commands\n\n```bash\n# Run tests with coverage\nnpx nx test:run postgrest-js\n\n# Update test snapshots and regenerate types\nnpx nx test:update postgrest-js\n\n# Type checking only\nnpx nx test:types postgrest-js\n\n```\n\n#### Test Infrastructure\n\nThe tests use Docker Compose to spin up:\n\n- **PostgreSQL** - Database with test schema and dummy data\n- **PostgREST** - REST API server that the client connects to\n\n```bash\n# Manually manage test infrastructure\nnpx nx db:run postgrest-js     # Start containers\nnpx nx db:clean postgrest-js   # Stop and remove containers\n```\n\n#### What `test:update` Does\n\nThe `test:update` command is useful when:\n\n- Database schema changes require updating TypeScript types\n- Test snapshots need to be updated after intentional changes\n\nIt performs these steps:\n\n1. Starts fresh database containers\n2. **Regenerates TypeScript types** from the actual database schema\n3. **Updates Jest snapshots** for all tests\n4. Cleans up containers\n\n#### Test Types Explained\n\n- **Format Check** - Ensures code formatting with Prettier\n- **Type Tests** - Validates TypeScript types using `tstyche`\n- **Generated Types Test** - Ensures generated types match database schema\n- **Unit Tests** - Jest tests covering all client functionality\n- **Smoke Tests** - Basic import/require tests for CommonJS and ESM\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n- **Docker** must be installed and running\n- **Port 3000** - PostgREST server (API)\n- **Port 8080** - Database schema endpoint (for type generation)\n\n**Note:** Unlike a full Supabase instance, this uses a minimal PostgREST setup specifically for testing the SDK.\n\n### Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions!
